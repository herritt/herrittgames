        Click the view to lock your cursor so you can look around correctly. Use arrow keys or W A S D keys to move your
        character. Once you've clicked the view, you won't be able to see your cursor - click ESC to see your cursor
        again.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Features</h2>
      <ul>You can walk around with the mouse and WASD keys, W is forward in the direction of the mouse, A is left, S is

      <ul>Press SPACE to jump</ul>
      <ul>2022.01.08 - Added a wall and duplicated the room wood furniture model to start building a template room.</ul>
      <ul>2022.01.09 - Added walls around a room, a door opening and door jam. Duplicated the room prefab to show two
        rooms.</ul>
